# ENSF511_LAB_-_Efficient_Models

This lab is to explore different efficient method for efficient models. 

In part 1, the model is trained with 224*224 cat and bobcat images.
Then the model is passed to Post-training float16 quantization	to reduce the file size of the model and compare performance.

In part 2, the model is trained with 112*112 image size and compares the performance of the model.

Detail of this lab including the trainning process, result, and evaluation of different model is presented in `ENSF511_LAB_3_Model_Optimizer.ipynb`.
